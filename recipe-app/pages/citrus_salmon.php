<p>I love how the citrus slices and bright colors take a simple salmon recipe and turn it into a beautiful – yet edible! – piece of art. This is a great dinner to make when you feel like enjoying a fancy meal, but don’t want to go crazy with the effort. It comes together in less than an hour, and you just need a simple side like potatoes or veggies to accompany it for a complete meal.</p>

    <li>Oranges– I like to use blood oranges or cara cara oranges, which are sweeter and pink-fleshed. Navel oranges or other oranges will work as well.
    </li>
    <li>Lemon – Lemon juice and lemon slices
    </li>
    <li>Salmon fillet – Choose fillets with a vibrant pink hue that smell clean instead of fishy. Opt for wild salmon if you can.
    </li>
    <li>Seasonings – I used a combination of dried oregano, mint, salt and pepper, and Aleppo pepper flakes, along with a few cloves of minced garlic. Aleppo pepper has a little kick and a sweeter finish, but if you don’t have it, red chili flakes will work
